%            radii

% xd, goal configuration
% xi, sphere center in configuration space
%     give [] if not within a Voronoi cell
%     this specifies ONLY the diffeomorphism
% ri, sphere radius in configuration space
% ei, width of annulus arouns sphere, in which the repulsive potential
%     is active
% r_in, radius on current ray of transformed patch Pi inner boundary
%     (obstacle boundary in configuration space)
% r_out, radius on current ray of transformed patch Pi outer boundary
%     (weighted Voronoi cell outer boundary selected here)

% Diffeomosphism applied
[q] = diffeomorphism(x, xc(:, idx), r(1, idx), r_in, r_out);
qd = xd; % same destination coordinate
qc = xc; % same obstacle centers
